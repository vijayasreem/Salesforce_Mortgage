User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to use the Document Verification App to verify my identity and address, determine my eligibility for a credit score, determine disbursement, and automatically approve payment. I also want to be able to verify vendor information and check for sufficient funds before the disbursement. Finally, I want to be able to close the App when I am done.
